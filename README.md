# Advanced-C-Application-Development

This hands-on course continues from COMP 2614 and prepares those who are already C# programmers 
for advanced C# application development. Students who also have HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery
will build on their C# experience to create Enterprise level desktop and N-Tier software applications.
Participants learn various software architectural patterns including "designing applications with
the Service Oriented Architecture" and "Scaling applications with Microservices and NServiceBUS 6".
Topics include: A review of ADO.NET and then a focus on Entity Framework (Code First, Model First,
and Database First), Repository Pattern, Object Serialization and Deserialization, Discussions include: 
Services (WCF, WEB API, and Microservices), Asynchronous Programming with async/await, C# Design Pattern 
Strategies, Dependency Injection and MEF. Labs and assignments reinforce best practices in the use of
architectural patterns. <br>
